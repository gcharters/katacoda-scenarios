## Modifying the Inventory Microservice

The inventory service is hardcoded to use bob and bobpwd as the credentials to authenticate against the name service. Youâ€™ll make these credentials configurable. In the Katacoda text editor, open the file /start/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java and replace the two lines under `\\ Basic Auth Credentials` with the following

```java
  // Basic Auth Credentials
  @Inject
  @ConfigProperty(name = "SYSTEM_APP_USERNAME")
  private String username;

  @Inject
  @ConfigProperty(name = "SYSTEM_APP_PASSWORD")
  private String password;

```

The changes introduced here use MicroProfile Config and CDI to inject the value of the environment variables `SYSTEM_APP_USERNAME` and `SYSTEM_APP_PASSWORD` into the SystemClient class.
